ChatGPT can be accessed using this link: https://chat.openai.com/

The link should bring you to a website that looks like the image below:

We wont be generating prompts yet,  however we will go over the different settings we have access to on their website. First, at the center top we can see two buttons allowing us to choose between two versions of ChatGPT models to use.

 In the previous version there was a drop down with the model we will use for the response we want to generate.

At the bottom in the middle of the page, there is space for us users to send a message. This will be the location where we write our prompt.

On the top left, there should be space that says create a new chat. Under the new chat, there should be a history of all your previous interactions with ChatGPT.  This is one of the most amazing features of ChatGPT its ability to remember what user said earlier in the conversation. It also allows user to provide follow-up corrections.

One of the unique feature of ChatGPT is that it can remember conversation. You can interact with a previous conversation with the pencil next to the chat history. You can delete a previous conversation by clicking the trashcan next to it then confirming. If you want to generate a whole new conversation you can click on the new chat button.  You can further clear all conversation using the clear conversations located at the bottom left.

### Bottom left Settings 

Please note that the bottom left setting can look a little different if you have ChatGPT subscription. 

Plus:

No ChatGPT Plus:
![Similar to previous image, but this time shows upgrade to plus instead of my plan](img/noPLUS.png)


The main difference, is the second thing under `clear conversations`. If you have a subscription you should see `my plan` and if not you should see `upgrade to Plus`.

Under that we can access the settings button. Inside the settings tab, we can switch our ChatGPT to a dark version mode. Additionally, we can use to export our data. The delete account, which will be used to delete our ChatGPT account.
